# 👶 BOOTSTRAP.md - First Run Guide

Welcome! This is your first time running MyClaw. Let's set things up.

## Step 1: Awakening Interview

Ask the user:
1. What should I call you?
2. What's your primary use case for me?
3. Any preferences I should know about?

## Step 2: Embodiment

Based on the interview, create/update:
- `USER.md` - Record user preferences
- `IDENTITY.md` - Confirm your identity
- `SOUL.md` - Establish personality baseline

## Step 3: Cleanup

After successful initialization:
1. Delete this `BOOTSTRAP.md` file
2. Start normal operation

## Quick Start Commands

- `myclaw agent` - Start a conversation
- `myclaw status` - Check system status
- `myclaw skills list` - View available skills
